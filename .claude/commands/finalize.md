# Finalize Feature

Complete a feature implementation with final quality checks, documentation updates, and git workflow. This command spawns the finalize-agent for final validation.

## Usage

```
/finalize <feature-name>
```

## Prerequisites

**Implementation should be complete!** All tasks in `tasks.md` should be marked done.

## Examples

```
/finalize user-authentication
/finalize dark-mode
```

## What This Does

1. **Runs quality checks** (using commands from CLAUDE.md):
   - Type/compile check
   - Lint/style check
   - Full test suite
   - E2E tests (if applicable)

2. **Validates completeness**:
   - All tasks in `tasks.md` marked complete
   - No TODO comments left in new code
   - No console.log statements (except intentional)
   - Tests cover new functionality

3. **Updates documentation**:
   - Updates project docs if new patterns introduced
   - Creates/updates relevant specs
   - Removes TODO markers from specifications

4. **Archives feature documentation**:
   - Creates `SUMMARY.md` with consolidated feature overview
   - Archives timestamped files
   - Summary includes: branch/commits, plan overview, changes made

5. **Prepares git workflow**:
   - Shows `git status` summary
   - Suggests commit message
   - Optionally creates commit
   - Optionally creates PR

## Quality Checklist

The finalize-agent verifies:

```
Code Quality
- [ ] Code compiles/builds without errors
- [ ] Linter passes
- [ ] No unused imports or variables
- [ ] Consistent code style

Testing
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New tests added for new functionality
- [ ] Edge cases covered
- [ ] No skipped tests without reason

Documentation
- [ ] Code comments where logic is complex
- [ ] Doc comments for public functions/components
- [ ] README/docs updated if needed

Security
- [ ] No secrets or credentials in code
- [ ] Input validation where needed
- [ ] Security policies if database changes

Accessibility (for UI changes)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works
- [ ] ARIA labels present
- [ ] Color contrast sufficient
```

## Output

Creates a finalization report:

```markdown
# Finalization Report: <feature-name>

## Quality Checks
- [x] Build/Compile: PASS
- [x] Lint: PASS
- [x] Tests: 142 passed, 0 failed
- [ ] E2E: SKIPPED (no new E2E tests)

## Task Completion
- Total tasks: 12
- Completed: 12
- Remaining: 0

## Files Changed
- 8 files modified
- 3 files created
- 0 files deleted

## Suggested Commit Message

feat(auth): implement unified auth check for protected routes

- Add useAuthCheck hook for session validation
- Update ProtectedRoute to use auth context
- Redirect to login on session expiry
- Add unit tests for auth flow

## Next Steps
- [ ] Review changes: `git diff`
- [ ] Create commit: `git add . && git commit`
- [ ] Push branch: `git push -u origin feature/...`
- [ ] Create PR: `gh pr create`
```

## Git Workflow Options

After finalization, you can:

**Option 1: Manual Review**
```bash
git status
git diff
# Review changes, then commit manually
```

**Option 2: Auto-Commit**
Ask the agent to create the commit with the suggested message.

**Option 3: Create PR**
Ask the agent to push and create a pull request.

## Handling Issues

If quality checks fail:
- Agent will report specific failures
- Suggest running `/diagnose` for test failures
- List files needing fixes

If tasks incomplete:
- Agent will list remaining tasks
- Suggest continuing with `/implement`

## Feature Archiving

When finalization completes, feature documentation is archived:

**What gets archived:**
- All timestamped `.md` files (research, plans, progress notes)
- `tasks.md` task breakdown file

**What remains:**
- `SUMMARY.md` - Consolidated summary for future reference

**Archive location:**
- `.claude/features/<feature-name>/archive.tar` (gitignored)
