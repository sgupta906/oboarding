================================================================================
                              KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

ISSUE 1: DARK MODE TOGGLE
─────────────────────────

Root Cause:
  - No dark mode toggle in NavBar
  - No theme state management
  - Components lack dark: variants
  - Tailwind dark mode not enabled

Solution:
  - Create useDarkMode() custom hook
  - Add Moon/Sun toggle button in NavBar
  - Add dark: variants to all components
  - Enable class-based dark mode in Tailwind

Architecture:
  - Hook manages state + localStorage persistence
  - Respects system preference as fallback
  - Zero external dependencies

Key Files:
  NEW:  src/hooks/useDarkMode.ts
  EDIT: src/components/ui/NavBar.tsx
  EDIT: tailwind.config.js
  EDIT: 6+ component files for dark: variants

Estimated Time: 2-3 hours


ISSUE 2: FIX ONBOARDING COMPLETE FOOTER
───────────────────────────────────────

Root Cause:
  - Footer logic based on progress percentage only
  - No validation against actual step statuses
  - No connection to step data (pending/completed/stuck)

Solution:
  - Pass steps array to WelcomeHeader
  - Check if ALL steps are "completed"
  - Only show completion when actually complete
  - Conditionally render progress bar OR completion message

Architecture:
  - Data-driven validation (not derived metrics)
  - Simple step.every() check
  - Prevents false positives

Key Files:
  EDIT: src/types/index.ts
  EDIT: src/components/onboarding/WelcomeHeader.tsx
  EDIT: src/views/EmployeeView.tsx

Estimated Time: 1-1.5 hours


ISSUE 3: FIX KPI TILE SIZING
───────────────────────────

Root Cause:
  - Cards lack explicit height constraints
  - Grid doesn't enforce uniform row heights
  - Tooltip positioning affects dimensions

Solution:
  - Add h-full flex flex-col to KPICard
  - Add auto-rows-fr to grid
  - Ensure tooltip doesn't shift layout

Architecture:
  - Pure CSS solution (no JavaScript overhead)
  - CSS Grid with flexbox
  - Responsive by design

Key Files:
  EDIT: src/components/manager/KPICard.tsx
  EDIT: src/components/manager/KPISection.tsx

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

================================================================================
                          IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP
================================================================================

SEQUENTIAL APPROACH (Recommended):
  1. Issue 1: Dark Mode Toggle        2-3 hours
  2. Issue 2: Completion Footer       1-1.5 hours
  3. Issue 3: KPI Sizing              30 minutes
  Total:                              4-5 hours

PARALLEL APPROACH (For teams):
  Team A: Issue 1 (2-3 hrs)
  Team B: Issue 2 (1-1.5 hrs, depends on A)
  Team C: Issue 3 (30 min, independent)
  Estimated parallelized time: 2.5-3.5 hours

  2. Reference CODE_CHANGES_REFERENCE.md for exact code
  3. Test after each completed issue
  4. Commit frequently with clear messages

AFTER IMPLEMENTATION:
  1. Run: npm run build (verify TypeScript)
  2. Run: npm run test (verify tests pass)
  3. Run: npm run lint (verify code quality)
  4. Manual testing across all views
  5. Create pull request with documentation links
  6. Request code review
  7. Deploy to staging for final QA

DEPLOYMENT:
